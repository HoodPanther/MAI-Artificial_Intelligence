# MAI-MachineLearning

A repository with the most relevant assignments in the Master of Artificial Intelligence.

I'm currently in my second semestre of the Master, as of this writing (February 2017). The repository will be updates as new projects are developed.

### Credits
Credits go to my UPC and UB professors, first for teaching me and second for all well designed exercises which couldn't have made this repository possible.
