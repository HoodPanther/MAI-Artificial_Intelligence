# Feedforward Neural Network

We investigate the use of feedforward neural networks as a CI approach for non-linear regression on a large clinical dataset. 
We show that the inherent grouping structure of the data by patients suggest standardization by subject for preprocessing, 
and perform model selection on different network architectures and training algorithms.
