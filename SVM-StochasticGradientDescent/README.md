This project is to try to reduce the churn of our new service. Modeling churn means to understand what keeps the customer engaged to our product. As an analyst, our goal is to predict or describe the churn rate i.e. the rate at which customer leave or cease the subscription to a service. Its value lies in the fact that engaging  new customers is often more costly than retaining existing ones. For that reason subscription business-based companies usually have proactive policies towards customer retention.

In this case study, we aim at building a machine learning model for customer churn prediction on data from a Telecom company. Each row on the dataset represents a subscribing telephone  customer. Each column contains customer attributes such as phone number, call minutes used during different times of day, charges incurred for services, lifetime account duration, and whether or not the customer is still a customer. Data can be found in the file: churn.csv.

In this exercise I implemented a Support Vector Machines classifier using Stochastic Gradient Descent from scratch. In order to practice the basic pipeline of the supervised learning task. The conclusions of the analysis can be found in Churn Conclusions file.
